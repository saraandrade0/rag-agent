# Quick Guide to the RAG Agent Demo

This project demonstrates how to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent.

## Main steps
1. Index documents with TF-IDF.
2. Query using cosine similarity.
3. Return the most relevant passages to the user question.
4. Use a simple routing logic to decide response type.

## Example questions
- "How does this AI agent work?"
- "Do I need internet to run it?"
- "Can I add new documents?"
